<h1>Chromaton</h1>

<p>Chromaton is a .NET library for syntax highlighting.  Our goal is to provide fast syntax highlighting for as many languages as possible.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Provide fast, simple text-highlighting capabilities for HTML and Windows applications.</li>
<li>Support all of the .NET languages (Including F#, IronPython, and IronRuby)</li>
<li>Maintain stylizations that are at least as robust as the common .NET IDEs.</li>

<li>Support (in an extensible way) hybrid languages, such as HTML &amp; JavaScript, ASPX &amp; VB, and Razor &amp; C#</li>
</ul><h2>Copying</h2>
